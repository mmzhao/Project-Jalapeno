All lines of dialogue should be formatted with these specifications:

*blah* - marks the characters who are well lit. Everyone else will be darkened
/ - separates the characters who are on the left part of the dialogue from those on the right side, the third partition designates the speaker
: - separates the character position info from the line of dialogue.
, - separates individual character names
Example:

*GeneralEvil*/CrystalGuy/GeneralEvil:Well, if it isn't my arch-nemesis, CrystalGuy.

Here, General Evil is speaking, well lit, and on the left side, CrystalGuy is darkened on the right side, and the dialogue is "Well, if it isn't my arch-nemesis, CrystalGuy."
